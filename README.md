# Idle Roman Empire Idle game

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kubaaa96/IdleRomanEmpire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kubaaa96/IdleRomanEmpire)

This will be idle game written in C++ with support of SFML and maybe Asio for communication with server. 

Main plan is to setup some prototype on Windows and maybe then create clinets for web and Mobile because most of the work will be done on server side to better practice Asio.
